# MaidConnect India-Hourly-Maid-Booking-Platform
MaidConnect India is a modern web application built with React and TypeScript that connects customers with professional maids. It provides role-based dashboards and features like customers can browse, filter, and book maids, manage bookings, and update their profiles, while maids can manage their profiles, availability, and receive notifications for bookings and cancellations. The app uses reusable components, protected routes, and React Context for managing user state, making it organized, efficient, and easy to use. The project is currently under development.
